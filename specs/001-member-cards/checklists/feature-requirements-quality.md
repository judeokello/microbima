# Feature Requirements Quality Checklist: Member Numbers and Printable Member Cards

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of requirements (spec and plan) before implementation. This checklist tests whether the requirements are well-written and unambiguous—not whether the implementation works.
**Created**: 2025-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [plan.md](../plan.md)

**Note**: Generated by `/speckit.checklist`. Use for PR review or author self-check of requirements quality.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for displaying the principal member number on the customer detail page, including when the value is missing? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for displaying each dependant's member number in the corresponding dependant cards (e.g. Spouse, Children)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the placement of the "Member cards" tab relative to Customer Details and Payments explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for which user roles or routes see the Member cards tab (admin vs non-admin vs dashboard)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Scope]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the empty-state message text or pattern specified when the customer has no policies or no member data? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for how cards are "grouped by policy" and "clearly separated" in the Member cards tab? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK007 Are all required fields on each card (scheme name, principal name, insured name, member number, DOB, date printed) explicitly listed and consistently referenced? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the source of "date printed" (member record creation date) and the fact that only the date component is shown documented in requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007, Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements specified for the package template preview screen (where it appears and what sample data is shown)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK010 Is it explicitly required that the template identifier field is not visible or editable in the package form? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010, Out of scope]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK011 Is "placeholder" for missing member number defined with an example or exact wording (e.g. "Not assigned")? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, FR-002, Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the canonical date format (DD/MM/YYYY) for cards explicitly stated and consistently required? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 Is "download action" defined to mean saving as a PNG image (format and intent)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK014 Is "default card layout" when no template is configured defined (single layout used for both preview and Member cards tab)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK015 Is "access same as customer detail page" defined so that implementers know no separate permission is required? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK016 Are "principal member name" and "insured member name" on the card defined (same for principal's card; dependant's name for dependant's card)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Key Entities]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK017 Are member-number-display requirements consistent between Customer Details tab (principal/dependant cards) and Member cards tab (placeholder when missing)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, FR-002, FR-008]
- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements for "no template configured" consistent between package preview and Member cards tab (default layout in both)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK019 Do scope boundaries (in scope / out of scope) align with functional requirements (e.g. no storage, no editing member numbers)? [Consistency, Spec Scope Boundaries]
- [ ] CHK020 Are the three customer detail page contexts (admin, non-admin, dashboard) required to behave consistently for member numbers and Member cards tab? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, Scope]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK021 Can "staff can see the principal and each dependant's member number" be verified without ambiguity (where to look, what counts as success)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK022 Can "obtain a downloadable PNG for each member per policy within the same session" be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK023 Can "confirm how a package's card will look by viewing the template preview" be verified (what constitutes confirmation)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK024 Are success criteria free of implementation details (e.g. no reference to specific APIs or components)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements defined for the primary scenario: customer with one policy, principal and dependants with member numbers? [Coverage, Spec User Story 1, 2]
- [ ] CHK026 Are requirements defined for the alternate scenario: customer with multiple policies (one group of cards per policy)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK027 Are requirements defined for exception/empty scenarios: no policies, no member numbers assigned, no card template configured? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK028 Is the behaviour when a member has no member number (placeholder, disabled download) specified for both Customer Details and Member cards tab? [Coverage, Spec Clarifications, FR-008]
- [ ] CHK029 Are requirements specified for the package preview scenario (sample data, default layout when no template)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011, FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK030 Is the behaviour when the customer has no policy or no member numbers assigned yet fully specified (Customer Details vs Member cards tab)? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK031 Is the behaviour when a dependant has no member number specified (show card with placeholder, disable download)? [Edge Case, Spec Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK032 Is the behaviour when a package has no card template configured specified (default layout for preview and Member cards)? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK033 Are requirements or assumptions stated for when scheme name cannot be resolved for a policy (e.g. no PackageSchemeCustomer)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK034 Is loading or error state for the Member cards tab (e.g. while fetching member-cards data) addressed in requirements? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional & Dependencies

- [ ] CHK035 Is the constraint that cards are not stored on the server explicitly stated and traceable to out-of-scope? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-006, Out of scope]
- [ ] CHK036 Is the dependency on "member numbers already assigned by the system" documented as an assumption? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK037 Is the dependency on "card templates defined and associated with packages outside this feature" documented? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK038 Are access control requirements (same as customer detail page, no separate permission) stated and consistent? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-003, Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK039 Is "clearly grouped" or "clearly separated" for multiple policies quantified or illustrated so implementers have a single interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK040 Is the exact sample data for package preview (e.g. names, member number, dates) specified in requirements or plan so it is consistent? [Clarity, Plan / research]
- [ ] CHK041 Is there any conflict between "show the tab" when customer has no policies and "display empty-state message when selected"? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK042 Are Key Entities (Principal member, Dependant, Policy, Package, Membership card) sufficient to resolve which data appears on which card? [Traceability, Spec Key Entities]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline (e.g. "Spec §FR-004: add example of grouping").
- Reference [spec.md](../spec.md) and [plan.md](../plan.md) for full context.
- Items are numbered sequentially (CHK001–CHK042) for traceability.
