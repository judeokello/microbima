-- Delete Specific Customers by IDs
-- ============================================
-- CONFIGURATION: Set your customer IDs here (comma-separated)
-- ============================================
-- Replace the UUIDs below with your actual customer IDs

-- Example: 'customer-id-1', 'customer-id-2', 'customer-id-3'
-- Use this temporary table approach for PostgreSQL compatibility
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers_to_delete (
    customer_id UUID
);

-- Clear the temp table first
TRUNCATE TABLE customers_to_delete;

-- Insert the customer IDs you want to delete
INSERT INTO customers_to_delete (customer_id) VALUES
('YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_1'),  -- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Replace with actual UUID
('YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_2'),  -- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Replace with actual UUID
('YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_3');  -- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Replace with actual UUID
-- Add more as needed, or remove lines you don't need
